        <h4>Aims</h4>
        <p>The Cambridge IGCSE Art and Design syllabus encourages a range of skills, stimulates aesthetic awareness, knowledge and critical understanding or art, and provides opportunities for learners to develop a range of skills. Crucially, the course provides opportunities for learners to engage in a personal and independent study. The syllabus encourages learners to explore, through practical works as well as experience, new media and technologies alongside traditional media and processes. This course is an excellent precursor for IB Diploma Visual Art and aims to prepare learners for further study with the Art and Design field.
        <h4>Course outline</h4>
        All learners will work towards two assessed areas. They will develop their coursework throughout their first year and for the first Semester of the second year. Learners will then have around two months to prepare for the timed ‘Externally Set Assignment’, which is the examination component, from January in their second year of the course.
